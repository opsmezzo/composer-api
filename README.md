# composer-api

`composer-api` is a collection of libraries for accessing the RESTful API for [`composer`](https://github.com/opsmezzo/composer).

## Libraries:

Each folder at the top level of this repository contains an API wrapper for a different environment. These environments are:

* **node.js**: [`./node.js/`](https://github.com/opsmezzo/composer-api/tree/master/node.js)

## Is your language missing?

If an API library for your language of choice is missing, feel free to write one and send us a [pull request](https://github.com/opsmezzo/composer-api/pulls). We'd be more than happy to accept community contributions!
